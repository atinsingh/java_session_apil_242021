### Software You need
1. JDK ( Java Development Kit ) - Version >= 1.8 <=Java 15 >  // Do not download Java 15
   Download from https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
2. IDE (Intelij Idea - Community Edition)
   Download from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/


### What is Programming ?
Set of intruction given to Machine to perform a task.

### What language computer uses ?
Machine Language  ? 0 and 1 -- Binary

CPU is the heart and soul
Assemebly Langagaue
CPUs have different architecure  ( Dual Core, QuadCore, AMD)

### Compiler / Interpreter
Compiler software which understand high level language
and convert to binary in one go

Interpreter read line by line and covert line to binary and execute

## What is high level language
    Its readable 
    Syntax Rule 
    -- C / C++ / CSharp, Object C -->  All these language is platform dependant
### Platform
    Operating System 
        - Windows 
        - Linux ( Fedora, Unbutu )
        - Mac
        - Unix
        - Solaris 
        - AS/400 
### Java -- Platform independent ? -- For Programmers

When you download JDK
its comes with following
- Compiler (Specific to your machine)
- JRE ( Java RunTime Env )
- JVM ( Java Virtual Machine) -- Is platform dependant

### Rule for naming java class (standards)

1. Name of class should always start with CapitalLetter
2. If class name has more than 1 word join the them using capitilization
   Example:  Learning java program should be written as LearningJavaProgramming
3. Do not use numbers in names
4. Avoid special chars


### 
{ } // curly braces of brackets
[] // square bracket
() - paranthesis
. // deference
; // semi-colon
: // colan

### Why we are doing programing
In programing we are processing data

## Where is the data ?
## RAM & ROM --> Random Access Memory // Read Only Memory
    Disk Based Memory // Disk Based Persint 

### Java very strict langauge
Data ->

     Numbers 
                --> Whole Numbers 
                                  + short 
                                 +  int age  // it will allocate 32 bits or 4 bytes  

                --> Decimal Number
